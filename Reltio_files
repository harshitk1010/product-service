surviviorship rules---
survivorship strategy or operational value (OV) rules, define a way to govern which attribute values must be identified as the OV.
This article explains the survivorship rules for defining the operational values of your object types.
These 'best values' are called the Operational Values, or winner values, and referred to as the OV of the attribute.

Each attribute can have 0, 1, or multiple values that have been marked as OV. The OV flag is a boolean property used by the Hub to determine which attribute values must be shown to the user.
The OV flag of each attribute value is calculated just-in-time whenever the entity's values are requested by either the Hub or a calling application.
Survivorship rules can be configured via the Hub or via the Configuration API.

Survivorship rules can be set for simple, nested, sub-nested, and referenced attributes. However, survivorship rules cannot be set for sub attributes of referenced attributes because survivorship rules for sub attributes are taken from the referenced entity/relation and can't be overridden on the sub attribute level.
if an address attribute has sub attributes such as AddressLine1, AddressLine2, and City, the survivorship rules for these sub attributes will be determined by the survivorship rules that are set for the Location entity.



strategy name 
LUD  Last Update Date. Attributes that were recently updated (with the maximum number of update dates) will have highest priority to be marked as OV. LUD is the default survivorship strategy.
LUD is the default survivorship strategy.

SRC_SYS 	Source System. The user provides a priority list of sources. A list of priority is defined for a mapping, if it’s absent, it is taken from the priority list of the group. All crosswalks from a source system with the highest priority become winners
 All crosswalks from a source system with the highest priority become winners, all values of those crosswalks also become winners.


Frequency Calculate amounts of crosswalks from which values were provided. Values with the most amount of crosswalks become winners.

Aggregation All presented values become winners (ov = True).

MinValue The smallest value becomes the winner. All crosswalks of those values become winners.

MaxValue Values with the highest value become winners. All crosswalks of those values become winners.

ValueBasedPriority - A user-defined priority list of attribute values determines the Operational Value (OV). The value with the highest priority becomes the winner. All crosswalks associated with this value are also marked as winners. 
    lookupCode
    lookupValue
    lookupRawValue

Fallback Strategies  -3 fallback crietria
1.MORE_THAN_ONE
If a strategy returns two or more winner values, its fallback strategy will use only the winner values and winner crosswalks from the strategy.
2.ZERO_OR_MORE_THAN_ONE
If there are zero winners, then all values from the strategy are considered by its fallback strategy. If there are two or more winners, then only winner values and winner crosswalks from the strategy are considered by its fallback strategy.
3.ZERO The ZERO option triggers fallback only when no winners exist in the primary survivorship step

You can use ignoreCase in the following survivorship strategies:

MinValue
MaxValue
Frequency
ValueBasedPriority
By default, ignoreCase is set to false. This preserves case-sensitive behavior for backward compatibility.

Survivorship calculation rules include:

Survivorship strategy: Applies specific rules to determine winner values.
Filtering settings: Splits all attribute values by defined criteria. Each split set of values has its own winner values
Fallback strategy settings: Indicates what strategy must be used to determine the winner if a main survivorship strategy couldn’t determine them or found a lot of them.
Ignored value: Ignored values do not participate in OV calculation.
Crosswalks with end date (delete date): Do not participate in OV calculation just as those crosswalks do not exist.
Default strategy: If an attribute does not have its own survivorship mapping, the default survivorship Last Update Date (LUD) is applied.

https://docs.reltio.com/en/applications/console/configuration-applications/data-modeler-at-a-glance/creating-a-new-match-rule


Matching is also used within the Reltio data tenant subscription service (DTSS) to match profiles stored within a data tenant to those within your tenant.
The three-step sequence of cleanse, match, and merge all occur in real-time
This behavior makes the Reltio platform ideal for real-time operational use within your data systems.

Match rules: Create entities, assign IDs, and then merge them using match rules in the Console Data Modeler (recommended method).
Match rules in the Data Modeler determine how to merge two or more entities and then combine them to build a consolidated profile. Reltio creates unique URIs for each entity before merging them. This enables you to unmerge them later if necessary.

Reltio enables you to merge profiles into a single, comprehensive record. Using match rules, Reltio intelligently determines which profiles to merge and which to exclude. When configuring match rules, you can specify, for example, whether the system should apply exact or fuzzy matching..

purpose- names, addresses, and emails through configurable conditions and thresholds, match rules identify potential duplicates and automatically consolidate them. This process ensures that your data remains accurate and consistent across systems, giving you cleaner, more reliable insights.

profiling the data,
selecting relevant attributes,
addressing data quality issues, and
balancing exact and fuzzy matching.

The matching functionality compares and merges duplicate records to ensure data validity.
 DTSS(Data Tenant Subscription Service) uses rules that are held in the Data Tenant’s configuration. If your tenant subscribes to a Reltio Data Tenant, your DTSS subscription may modify the behavior of the Data Tenant’s match rules but not significantly.

Interview Question:
---------------------
1.Survivorship

2.MatchRule..

1. Data profiling.

1. Collect multiple data sources and associated metadata
2. Cleanse data to eliminate duplicates, find anomalies, unify the structure, and discover interrelationships.
3. Run statistical reports to uncover structural, content, and relationships information.
Data profiling reports help to form the foundation of Data Quality Reporting.

2. Match field url

Match rules in the Data Modeler determine how to merge two or more entities and then combine them to build a consolidated profile. Reltio creates unique URIs for each entity before merging them.
* Match: Identifies and collects the occurrences of the same or similar entities.
* Merge: Compares and applies rules to combine entities, when possible.
* Survivorship: Enables certain entities to persist, even when there are similar entities.
—
* Match rules: Create entities, assign IDs, and then merge them using match rules in the Console Data Modeler (recommended method).Match rules in the Data Modeler determine how to merge two or more entities and then combine them to build a consolidated profile. Reltio creates unique URIs for each entity before merging them. This enables you to unmerge them later if necessary. For more information, see topic Configure match rules overview .
* Add an Entity type API: Specify whether to match and merge on-the-fly when you create an entity using the matchBeforeCreate property. For more information, see topic Merge-on-the-fly.

——

3. If any possible to particular profile based survivour strategcy

MaxValue Rule
This rule selects the maximum value held in the attribute. The maximum value is defined as follows for different data types:
* Numeric: MaxValue is the largest numeric value.
* Date: MaxValue is the maximum timestamp value.
* Boolean: True is the MaxValue
* String: MaxValue is based on the lexicographical sort order of the strings.

Fallback strategy chains use not only winner values but also winner crosswalks of those values. Therefore, if a value with multiple crosswalks becomes a winner on a calculation step with just a few winner crosswalks, only those winner crosswalks are used on the next calculation step.

———

4. how match rule config region based.


Match Rule Editor
Overview
At times, it could be challenging to write match rules by using JSON.
The Match Rules Editor feature within the Data Modeler allows you to create and modify basic match rules without having to depend on a skillset of writing JSON code and use of a JSON editor. The Rule Builder within the editor is intuitive and enables you to develop a match rule easily by selecting attributes, match rule comparison operators, comparator classes, and match token classes. The editor also offers the Advanced Editor where you can write JSON code, if needed, for more complex functionality.
Benefits
The Match Rule Editor offers the following key benefits:
* Configure match rules with little or no knowledge of JSON configuration syntax.
* Use the Analyzer tool to holistically analyze your rule set for redundancy and inefficiencies.
* Dramatically reduce your match rule development time.
Features
* A Rules builder provides the framework for you to create a match rule using item selections rather than writing JSON code.
* Supports use of And/And not/Or/Or not operators.
* Supports the Reltio Name Dictionary to enable matching on synonyms of first names.
* Supports ignoreInToken to suppress token generation for selected attributes.
* The logical version of the rule you developed is displayed for review in compact form.
* An Advanced Editor that synthesizes the JSON equivalent code block for the selections made within the Rules Builder, but allows you to add code for features of the match framework that are not yet supported by the Rules Builder.

5. what is more than one and zero to more than one

Survivorship rules can be configured via the Hub or via the Configuration API.

https://docs.reltio.com/en/model/consolidate-data/design-survivorship-rules/survivorship-rules


6. how to config clean function


note: While working with the tenant configuration, ensure that you:
* Use tenant configuration to declare custom cleanse functions and to specify per-tenant properties.
* Use the POST /tenants and GET /tenants/tenantid requests to configure tenants. Cleanse functions use a separate API that is only available to the tenant admin.

https://docs.reltio.com/en/model/cleanse-data/cleanse-and-standardize-data-overview/configuring-cleanse-functions/best-practices-for-data-profiling-and-cleanse

7. cleans verification

What's the difference between Cleaning Validation and Cleaning Verification? Validation is confirming that the most effective cleaning methods are instituted from the beginning. Verification is ensuring validated cleaning methods are being properly implemented.


8. unresolved canonical 

https://support.reltio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6584284635661-How-can-I-change-lookup-canonical-values-without-having-to-reload-profile-data


9. how config true and false but that winning is based on false

Fallback strategy chains use not only winner values but also winner crosswalks of those values. Therefore, if a value with multiple crosswalks becomes a winner on a calculation step with just a few winner crosswalks, only those winner crosswalks are used on the next calculation step.



10. what are the steps for address cleanse
Reltio platform automatically runs address cleansing for updated address values and returns verification status and codes. Values for "Address Line 1", "Address Line 2", "City", "State", "Country" and other attributes are only returned for verified addresses

Yes, you can use the cleanse API from Reltio.  This is not a direct API to Loqate, it is an API from Reltio which inturn gives you the cleansed address. 

If you are invoking it from other application,  it would still be counted against your API entitlements .



11.how to config security in reltio


Security can be set at an entity/relationship type level or for individual attributes.
The Reltio Connected Data Platform platform supports role-based access control with its metadata security framework. Each role has a list of resources with operations that users assigned to the role can do on each resource. Security can be set at an entity/relationship type level or for individual attributes.


12.what is data provider
Data providers supply attribute values for an object and the attributes are associated with the crosswalk.
Data may come to Reltio from multiple sources. Each source must be registered in Reltio, and all data loaded into a tenant will be associated with a data source. If no source is specified when creating an object, the source will default to "Reltio". Crosswalks do not just apply to the entity level, Reltio associates each supplied attribute with data provider crosswalks.
A crosswalk can represent a data provider or a non-data provider:
* Data providers supply attribute values for an object and the attributes are associated with the crosswalk.
* Non-data providers are associated with an overall entity (or relationship). In this case it is simply used to link a Reltio object with an object in another system. Supplied attributes will NOT be associated with this crosswalk.


13.how config surogate corsswalk…
https://docs.reltio.com/en/model/construct-your-data-model/define-or-refine-your-data-model/define-crosswalks-for-data-sources/configuring-surrogate-keys

If your source system (perhaps it is a simple file) doesn't provide a unique ID for an entity you wish to create, you can specify a source name for the crosswalk and ask Reltio to synthesize the crosswalk value. This is called a surrogate crosswalk.

The concatenated, cleansed values of the Location entity are used to construct a surrogate key, for example, a combination of AddrLine1, AddrLine2, and City. Whenever a clean value of a Location entity, which is similar to a previously loaded Location entity, is loaded in Reltio, its surrogate key will be identical to the key of the previously loaded location entity.
Assigning surrogate keys
Reltio automatically cleanses and standardizes any location or address entity that is posted on the Reltio platform. A key can be explicitly assigned to the Location entity or Reltio can automatically generate it using the surrogate key function.
To automatically assign a key to the Location entity, the option must be enabled for each source that provides address entities by specifying the value of the refEntity attribute as Surrogate in the incoming JSON. In this example, the sp ecified refEntity attribute value is Surrogate for the FB source.

14.how to config source table

The steps for analysing and data profiling of the new source are below:
1. Conduct a mapping exercise to determine if the new data set maps into the existing configuration (If new attributes are required, that work will be done in the Configuration step below).
2. Use any analysis tool to profile the data set to be loaded into Reltio.
3. Identify any data quality issues with the data set.
4. Decide with the client how to address any data quality identified (i.e. Resolve data quality issues in the source prior to loading the new data set into Reltio, or ensure enough data stewards are staffed to resolve suspect matches).
5. Identify if there is a unique ID column (for ex. personID / orgID)  in source, which can be used as crosswalk ID. if none exists, identify if concatenation of columns can be used to create a unique  key.
6. Determine if there is a need for configuring a lookupType (RDM) for the new source. Or if existing RDM lookups can be used, determine the values for the lookups.
7. Determine if the introduction of new data will require additions or changes to the existing set of match rules.

15.what is master data , transactional data, reference data

Master data provides a stable reference point for consistency and long-term analysis, while transactional data offers real-time insights and supports day-to-day operations. The combination of both ensures a comprehensive and flexible data strategy that can address various organisational needs.

Reference Data is the data used to categorise, classify, or define other data elements. It provides context and meaning to master and transactional data. Examples of reference data include units of measure, currency codes, and country codes.

16. what is data model

18. Survivorship Advanced concept…

Advanced Survivorship Behaviour covers the last update date, some values, and same was recent crosswalk strategies.
Reltio Survivorship is the process of deciding which value contributes to the golden record (OV) between the many potential values provided by the entity's crosswalks. Each attribute in reltio has a survivorship rule, if none is explicitly defined “Recency is used by default..

Reltio is a cloud-native, multi-tenant SaaS platform built for real-time MDM.
Reltio offers advanced survivorship rules, matching algorithms (exact, fuzzy, AI/ML-based), and configurable workflows.
Supports schema-less data modeling via L3 configuration

When NOT to Use Reltio
Situation	Consider Alternatives
Very small dataset, no real-time needs	Lighter tools like Talend, Informatica Cloud
Deeply integrated SAP-only environment	SAP MDG
On-premise infrastructure only	Legacy MDM tools

5.Why we need MDM 
data is fragmented, duplicated, inconsistent, and siloed across multiple systems. MDM solves these problems by providing a single, trusted, consistent view of the most important business entities like customers, products, suppliers, employees, etc.
MDM makes sure your business-critical data is accurate, unified, and useful — no matter where it comes from or where it goes.

6.What is RDM and why we need it.

1.Avoid Inconsistent Reference Values
* Without RDM, different systems might use different values for the same thing. 
2.Improve Data Quality
* By enforcing valid values, RDM eliminates typos, invalid codes, and rogue entries. 
3.RDM systems like Reltio RDM support draft → publish → deprecate workflows.


7.what is difference between RDM tenant vs MDM tenant

MDM Tenant = A system managing all the people in a university (students, faculty, staff).
RDM Tenant = A lookup system that defines all valid departments, courses, countries, and statuses used by the university system.
Match & Merge	✅ Yes – supports survivorship, match rules, merge	❌ No – no survivorship or merging needed
Survivorship Rules	✅ Yes – heavily used for golden records	❌ Not applicable
Relationships	✅ Yes – graph-based relationships supported	❌ No – flat lists only

Write technical documentation and provide post-deployment support.


ans ; Whenever mdm creates a transcode problem, rdm creates an unmapped values 
In the rdm once we open look up type values we can see unmapped values error

Application for Reltio MDM Developer – Available for Onsite/Offshore


=====

Reltio supports survivorship rules and ML-driven data cleansing (e.g., choosing the most accurate name/email/phone from multiple sources).

Reltio's low-code/no-code configuration and prebuilt connectors (Salesforce, SAP, Snowflake) help teams go live faster than with legacy MDM tools.




A lookup is a data fetch operation within a recipe used to:
* Query an external system or database 
* Fetch values to enrich or validate data For example, a lookup to Snowflake to get customer region.
