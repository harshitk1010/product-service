Aspect	MatchToken	Comparator
Purpose	Prepare data	Compare data
Stage	Before comparison	During comparison
Input	Raw attribute value	Tokenized values
Output	Tokens	Similarity score
Focus	Normalization	Accuracy
Examples	LOWERCASE, PHONETIC, NGRAM	EXACT, FUZZY, JARO
-----
In Reltio, MatchToken prepares and standardizes attribute values for matching, while Comparator evaluates similarity between those prepared values to calculate a match score....
==========
Name Matching Rule

MatchToken:

Lowercase

Remove punctuation

Split words

Comparator:

Fuzzy / Jaro-Winkler

Result:

"Harshit Kumar" ≈ "H. Kumar"

survivorship rules



Match and merge rule



LCA configuration


=====
Why is MDM important?

Answer:

Eliminates duplicate & inconsistent data

Improves data quality and governance

Enables better analytics & decision-making

Supports regulatory compliance
===

Rules that decide which attribute value wins when multiple source records are merged.

Example:

Source priority

Most recent update

Longest value
=====
What is Match & Merge?

Answer:

Match: Identify duplicate records

Merge: Combine duplicates into a single golden record
====
What is Data Governance in MDM?

Answer:
Policies, roles, processes, and standards to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and ownership.

====
What are common Data Quality dimensions?

Answer:

Accuracy

Completeness

Consistency

Timeliness

Uniqueness
==========
What is inbound vs outbound integration?

Answer:

Inbound: Source → MDM

Outbound: MDM → downstream systems
=====
What is the role of APIs in MDM?

Answer:

Create/update master data

Search & retrieve golden records

Real-time integrations
===============
new features with AI enhancement..
🔹 AI-Driven Match & Merge (FERN)
Earlier: Heavy dependency on complex match rules
Now:
AI learns matching patterns automatically
Fewer false positives & less steward effort

Faster onboarding of new data sources
👉 Practical impact: Less time tuning match rules, more accurate Golden Records.
--------
🔹 AI-Assisted Stewardship (AgentFlow)
Earlier: Manual duplicate resolution
Now:
AI suggests merge/split decisions
Stewards validate instead of investigating
👉 Practical impact: 30–40% reduction in stewardship workload.
-------
🔹 Unstructured Data Ingestion
PDFs, documents, external files ingested via AI extraction
👉 Practical impact:
Supplier contracts, onboarding forms, KYC docs can enrich master data — not just structured feeds.
-------
🔹 Survivorship Improvements
Smarter fallback logic
Attribute-level defaulting
👉 Practical impact:
Golden Record remains stable even when high-priority sources go down.
---------
🔹 Observability & Monitoring
API usage
Match performance
Pipeline health
👉 Practical impact:
MDM teams can detect issues before business users complain.
“Reltio’s recent enhancements reduce rule complexity, increase AI-driven automation, and make Golden Records directly consumable for analytics and GenAI use cases.”
Reltio Entity Resolution applies AI and LLM-based models to match and merge records across disparate systems, creating a universal ID with high precision and speed.

1.Reltio AgentFlow™
    Data Explorer: Explore entity profiles and relationships in read-only mode
    Resolver: Analyze and resolve potential duplicates automatically with optional external enrichment
    Work Assigner: Redistribute workflow tasks across active stewards to maintain balanced queues
    Address Enricher: Validate and correct entity addresses using trusted external sources
    Product Recommender: Suggest personalized products using customer profiles, interactions, and graph signals
    Unmerger: Automatically audit and unmerge records that were incorrectly merged

2.Reltio Integration for Veeva Vault CRM™
enables a single, trusted view that improves engagement quality, speeds decisions, and reduces compliance risk without the cost and complexity of custom pipelines

3.Reltio Data Sharing with Databricks
Reltio Data Sharing with Databricks allows you to securely access AI-ready and trusted data from Reltio in near real time directly within Databricks, without moving or copying data. No traditional extract - load - transform (ELT) data pipeline steps required.

4.Unstructured Data Studio
    AI-powered extraction: Ingest individual file(s) from sources like Google Drive, or S3. Automatically extract relevant entities, so data stewards can focus on reviewing, not retyping.
    Mapping to Reltio profiles: Extracted data is intelligently mapped to Reltio's data model.
    Approval workflows: All changes are routed through configurable approval steps through workflows.
    Document lineage: Source files can be stored and deep-linked within profiles when needed, supporting both regulatory and operational traceability.
    Batch or real-time processing: Run document processing on a schedule or trigger it on demand.

5.Address Auto Complete
Address Auto Complete captures clean, standardized addresses at source. This API capability improves data quality at the point of entry by providing type-ahead address suggestions and returning complete, standardized addresses.

6.Real time Email and Phone Verification
Reltio real time Email and Phone Verification enables you to verify contacts as they are captured, or cleanse them in bulk before usage.

7.FERN with modes
FERN now supports multiple matching modes to give you greater control and precision when resolving your data. You can choose from three pre-configured modes — Enhanced Discovery, Data Steward, and Full Mode —

8.Survivorship defaults and fallback handling
Configurable default survivorship strategies - Set the default survivorship strategy at the tenant or object type level (entity or relationship). Object-level settings override tenant-level, with Last Updated Date (LUD) used as the fallback for backward compatibility.
Dedicated fallback for zero values  - you can apply different fallback logic when no values are available versus when multiple values exist.
Added optional ignoreCase: true parameter for Min, Max, Frequency, and Value-Based Priority strategies to treat case-variant values (e.g., "USA" vs "usa") as equal. Defaults to false for backward compatibility.

Matchtoken vs Comparator class..

comparator
Exact, ExactOrNull, ExactOrAllNull, notExactSame, and Fuzzy
--
Match Token Class selects which records should be compared, while Comparator Class determines how similar the values are to decide a match.
Email = john.smith@gmail.com
Tokens → john, smith, gmail

john.smith@gmail.com
vs
jon.smith@gmail.com
→ High similarity → MATCH

Match Token = “Who should I compare?”
Comparator = “How similar are these two values?”
