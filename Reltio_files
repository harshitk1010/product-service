Phase 2 — Read-Only GenAI Integration

Connect GenAI to:

Reltio Search API

Entity History API

Implement:

Prompt templates

Query validation

Rate limits

--
MDM: Reltio

GenAI: Azure OpenAI (most common)

Integration: MuleSoft / Boomi / AWS Lambda

UI: Web app, Teams, Slack, Salesforce

=====
Aspect	MatchToken	Comparator
Purpose	Prepare data	Compare data
Stage	Before comparison	During comparison
Input	Raw attribute value	Tokenized values
Output	Tokens	Similarity score
Focus	Normalization	Accuracy
Examples	LOWERCASE, PHONETIC, NGRAM	EXACT, FUZZY, JARO
-----
In Reltio, MatchToken prepares and standardizes attribute values for matching, while Comparator evaluates similarity between those prepared values to calculate a match score....
==========
Name Matching Rule

MatchToken:

Lowercase

Remove punctuation

Split words

Comparator:

Fuzzy / Jaro-Winkler

Result:

"Harshit Kumar" ≈ "H. Kumar"
===============================
“Integration Hub fits best in an event-driven MDM architecture, enabling scalable, loosely coupled integrations without impacting Reltio core performance.

===
survivorship rules



Match and merge rule



LCA configuration


=====
Why is MDM important?

Answer:

Eliminates duplicate & inconsistent data

Improves data quality and governance

Enables better analytics & decision-making

Supports regulatory compliance
===

Rules that decide which attribute value wins when multiple source records are merged.

Example:

Source priority

Most recent update

Longest value
=====
What is Match & Merge?

Answer:

Match: Identify duplicate records

Merge: Combine duplicates into a single golden record
====
What is Data Governance in MDM?

Answer:
Policies, roles, processes, and standards to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and ownership.

====
What are common Data Quality dimensions?

Answer:

Accuracy

Completeness

Consistency

Timeliness

Uniqueness
==========
What is inbound vs outbound integration?

Answer:

Inbound: Source → MDM

Outbound: MDM → downstream systems
=====
What is the role of APIs in MDM?

Answer:

Create/update master data

Search & retrieve golden records

Real-time integrations
===============
new features with AI enhancement..
🔹 AI-Driven Match & Merge (FERN)
Earlier: Heavy dependency on complex match rules
Now:
AI learns matching patterns automatically
Fewer false positives & less steward effort

Faster onboarding of new data sources
👉 Practical impact: Less time tuning match rules, more accurate Golden Records.
--------
🔹 AI-Assisted Stewardship (AgentFlow)
Earlier: Manual duplicate resolution
Now:
AI suggests merge/split decisions
Stewards validate instead of investigating
👉 Practical impact: 30–40% reduction in stewardship workload.
-------
🔹 Unstructured Data Ingestion
PDFs, documents, external files ingested via AI extraction
👉 Practical impact:
Supplier contracts, onboarding forms, KYC docs can enrich master data — not just structured feeds.
-------
🔹 Survivorship Improvements
Smarter fallback logic
Attribute-level defaulting
👉 Practical impact:
Golden Record remains stable even when high-priority sources go down.
