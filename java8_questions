java 8 questions
=======

In this code, when you call Collections.sort(empList), Java internally uses the overridden compareTo method of the Employee class to compare objects and sort the list accordingly.
The compareTo method compares the empId of the current Employee object (this) with the empId of the Employee object being compared to (e). It returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if this is less than, equal to, or greater than e, respectively.

Comparator interface is used to define custom comparison logic
Comparator interface defines a single method called compare(Object o1, Object o2), which compares two objects and returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer depending on whether the first object is less than, equal to, or greater than the second object, respectively.

Comparator instances can be passed to sorting methods like Collections.sort() or Arrays.sort() to sort objects based on the defined criteria.

Java has two types of streams:

Primitive Stream	Object Stream
IntStream	Stream<Integer>
LongStream	Stream<Long>
DoubleStream	Stream<Double>

Many collectors like groupingBy() work on object streams, not primitive streams.

So we convert primitives → objects using boxed().

Intermediate Operations: filter, map, sorted, etc., which return a new stream.
Terminal Operations: collect, forEach, reduce, etc., which produce a result or side-effect.
Parallel Processing: Streams can be converted to parallel streams for better performance in large datasets.

Backward Compatibility: Default methods enable you to add new methods to existing interfaces without requiring all implementing classes to provide an implementation.

Benefits of Method References
Improved Readability:
Reusability:
Reduced Errors: 
Elegant Code: 

Benefits of the Optional Class
Avoids NullPointerExceptions:
Improves Code Readability:
Reduces Boilerplate Code:

Key Methods of the Optional Class
ofNullable(value): Creates an Optional that can contain a value or be empty if the value is null.
isPresent():
orElse(value): Returns the value if present; otherwise, returns a default value.
map(Function): Applies a function to the value if present and returns a new Optional.
flatMap(Function): Similar to map, but avoids nesting of Optional.

map()	flatMap()
One-to-One	One-to-Many
Returns Stream<T>	Returns flattened Stream<T>
No nesting	Removes nesting

map() transforms each element, while flatMap() transforms and flattens nested structures into a single stream.
